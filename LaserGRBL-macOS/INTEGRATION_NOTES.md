## Testing Checklist for Hardware Day

When GRBL hardware is available, test in this order:

### 1. Basic Connection (5 minutes)
```
[ ] Connect USB cable to GRBL device
[ ] Launch app
[ ] Click "Refresh Ports" - should see device
[ ] Select port (usually /dev/cu.usbserial-* or /dev/cu.usbmodem*)
[ ] Choose baud rate: 115200
[ ] Click "Connect"
[ ] Console should show: "Grbl X.X ['$' for help]"
[ ] Sidebar should show state: "Idle" or "Alarm"
[ ] Connection indicator turns green
```

### 2. Status Monitoring (5 minutes)
```
[ ] Check sidebar shows machine state
[ ] Position display updates (MPos/WPos)
[ ] Watch console for status queries (?)
[ ] Verify 5Hz update rate (smooth, not jumpy)
[ ] Check feed rate display (if running)
```

### 3. Basic Commands (10 minutes)
```
[ ] Switch to Control tab
[ ] Try soft reset (should see "Grbl X.X" again)
[ ] Send $X to clear alarm (if needed)
[ ] Send $$ to view settings (console should show settings)
[ ] Send $# to view parameters
[ ] Verify all commands appear in console
```

### 4. Jogging (15 minutes)
```
⚠️ WARNING: Ensure machine has room to move!

[ ] Check jog distance: 1mm
[ ] Click X+ (should move right 1mm)
[ ] Click X- (should move left 1mm)
[ ] Click Y+ (should move away)
[ ] Click Y- (should move toward)
[ ] Try Z+ and Z- if safe
[ ] Increase jog distance to 10mm
[ ] Test again - should move 10mm
[ ] Watch console for $J=... commands
[ ] Verify position updates in sidebar
```

### 5. System Commands (10 minutes)
```
⚠️ WARNING: Homing may cause movement!

[ ] Click "Home" (if homing enabled)
    - Machine should move to limits
    - State should change to "Home"
    - Then return to "Idle"
[ ] Click "Zero XY"
    - Work position should show 0.000, 0.000
[ ] Jog away from zero
[ ] Click "Go to Zero"
    - Machine should return to zeroed position
[ ] Test "Clear Alarm" if alarm triggered
```

### 6. G-Code Streaming (20 minutes)
```
⚠️ TODO: Streaming button needs to be added to UI

Current status: Backend ready, UI button not implemented
When implemented:
[ ] Load a simple G-code file
[ ] Click "Send" or "Run" button
[ ] Watch console for command streaming
[ ] Verify buffer stays under 15 commands
[ ] Monitor progress
[ ] Test Pause button
[ ] Test Resume button
[ ] Test Stop button (soft reset)
```

### 7. Console Logging (5 minutes)
```
[ ] Send various commands
[ ] Check TX (sent) messages appear
[ ] Check RX (received) messages appear
[ ] Test filter: "Sent" only
[ ] Test filter: "Received" only
[ ] Test filter: "Errors" only
[ ] Test "Clear Console"
[ ] Toggle auto-scroll on/off
[ ] Try to select and copy text
```

### 8. Error Handling (10 minutes)
```
[ ] Send invalid command (e.g., "INVALID")
    - Should see "error:3" or similar
    - Console shows error in red
[ ] Trigger alarm (move beyond soft limits if enabled)
    - State should change to "Alarm"
    - Error message appears
[ ] Clear alarm with $X
[ ] Test disconnect during operation
    - Should handle gracefully
    - No crashes
```

### 9. Edge Cases (10 minutes)
```
[ ] Disconnect and reconnect USB cable
    - App should detect disconnection
    - Reconnect should work
[ ] Connect at wrong baud rate
    - Should see garbage or no response
    - Change baud rate and retry
[ ] Send commands very rapidly
    - Buffer management should prevent overflow
[ ] Fill command queue (send 50+ commands)
    - Should queue smoothly
    - No buffer overflow
```

### 10. Performance (5 minutes)
```
[ ] Let status query run for 1 minute
    - Should be smooth (5 updates/second)
    - No lag or stuttering
    - Console should scroll smoothly
[ ] Check console with 1000+ messages
    - Should remain responsive
    - Auto-scroll works
    - No memory issues
```

## Known Limitations (Expected)

These are not bugs, but expected limitations for Phase 2:

1. **No G-code streaming button** - Backend ready, UI button needs to be added
2. **No progress bar during streaming** - Tracking implemented, UI needs enhancement
3. **No feed/spindle override controls** - GRBL supports, UI not implemented
4. **No custom button support** - Planned for future phase
5. **No WiFi/Telnet support** - Planned for future phase
6. **Arc rendering** - G2/G3 drawn as lines (Phase 1 limitation)

---

## If Issues Found

### Report Format
```markdown
**Issue:** Brief description
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Expected:** What should happen
**Actual:** What actually happened
**Console Output:** (paste relevant lines)
**Machine State:** Idle/Run/Alarm/etc.
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** No ports found  
**Solution:** Check USB cable, try "Refresh Ports", check `ls /dev/cu.*` in Terminal

**Issue:** Connection fails  
**Solution:** Try different baud rate (115200, 9600, 57600), check GRBL is responding

**Issue:** Commands not executing  
**Solution:** Check for alarm state, send $X to unlock, verify GRBL is idle

**Issue:** Position not updating  
**Solution:** Check console for status responses, verify 5Hz queries, restart connection

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 hardware testing is successful if:

✅ Can connect and disconnect reliably  
✅ Status updates smoothly at 5Hz  
✅ Jog commands move machine correctly  
✅ System commands work (home, zero, etc.)  
✅ Console logs all communication  
✅ No crashes or freezes  
✅ Handles errors gracefully  
✅ Performance is smooth

---

## Next Steps After Hardware Testing

1. **Fix any issues found** during testing
2. **Add streaming button** to G-Code tab
3. **Enhance progress tracking** UI
4. **Add feed/spindle overrides** if desired
5. **Begin Phase 3** - Image import and raster conversion

---

**Current Status:** Ready for hardware testing  
**Expected Testing Time:** ~90 minutes  
**Priority:** High - Validation of core Phase 2 functionality
